        "redmine-mcp": {
            "type": "stdio",
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
                "-y",
                "redmine-mcp",
                "http://svn.aps1aws.lumiq.int", // NOTE :- Don't use https here
                "<API_KEY>",
                "<PROJECT_ID>" // e.g., empower-roadmap
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
